Sys/HostIP version 0.01
=======================

This is a rewrite of the antiquated Sys::HostIP. Sys::HostIP is now written
as a class, and is now taint safe. The Win32 code is totally untested; if
anyone wants to work on it, feel free. Also, there are many Unixes that I
didn't have access to; any help with those platforms would be useful as
well. Currently, I've tested this module on (Free|Net|Open)BSD, Linux, IRIX,
Solaris, and OSX/Darwin.

Sys/HostIP version 1.3.1
=======================

This is a rewrite of the antiquated Sys::HostIP. Sys::HostIP is now written
as a class, and is now taint safe. The following methods are exported:

	ip() - returns a "best guess" ip address (on machines with only one
	       network interface, this returns that interfaces ip address)
	ips() - returns an array reference of all ip addresses on a machine
	interfaces() - returns a reference to a hash of interface:ip address 
		pairs

Currently, I've tested this module on (Free|Net|Open)BSD, Linux, IRIX, Solaris,
Windows XP, Cygwin, and OSX/Darwin.

NAME
    Sys::HostIP - Try extra hard to get ip address related info

VERSION
    version 1.4

SYNOPSIS
      use Sys::HostIP; 
  
      #class methods 
      my $ip_address = Sys::HostIP->ip; 

      # $ip_address is a scalar containing a best guess of your host machines 
      # ip address. On unix systems, it will return loopback (127.0.0.1) if it 
      # can't find anything else. This is also exported as a sub (to keep 
      # compatability with older versions).

      my $ip_addresses = Sys::HostIP->ips; 

      # $ip_addresses is an array ref containing all the ip addresses of your
      # machine 

      my $interfaces = Sys::HostIP->interfaces;

      # $interfaces is a hash ref containg all pairs of interfaces/ip addresses
      # Sys::HostIP could find on your machine.

      Sys::HostIP->ifconfig("/somewhere/that/ifconfig/lives");
      # you can set the location of ifconfig with this class method if the code
      # doesn't seem to know where your ifconfig lives

DESCRIPTION
    Sys::HostIP does what it can to determine the ip address of your
    machine. All 3 methods work fine on every system that I've been able to
    test on. (Irix, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Linux, OSX, Win32,
    Cygwin). It does this by parsing ifconfig(8) (ipconfig on Win32/Cygwin)
    output.

  EXPORT
    Nothing by default!

    But, if you ask for it nicely, you'll get:

    ip(), ips(), interfaces(), and ifconfig().

    To export something explicitly, use the syntax:

        use HostIP qw/ip ips interfaces/;
        # that will get you those three subroutines, for example

    I haven't tested the win32 code with dialup or wireless connections.
